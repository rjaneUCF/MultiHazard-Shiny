This repository contains code for a Shiny app for a bivarite joint probability analysis. The app extensivly calls R functions in the [MultiHazard package](https://github.com/rjaneUCF/MultiHazard). 

Example time series of rainfall from Miami Airport and water level at coastal control strucuture S-22 can be found in the Data folder.

We recommend not detrending rainfall.

Shiny should work for any time series, provided the data/time column is of class "Date".
